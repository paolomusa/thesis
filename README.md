# Thesis Repository – Supporting Files

**Author:** Giovanni Paolo Musa  
**Thesis Title:** Modeling Cross-Lingual Lexical Difficulty: a Machine Learning Analysis of Bidirectional Learning in Duolingo  
**Degree / Program:** Data Science & Society  
**University:** Tilburg University  
**Year:** 2026  

This repository contains all the main computational materials used for my thesis, including:

- Python notebooks used for data construction and analysis  
- Final constructed datasets  
- Intermediate and final results for each research question  
- Figures, tables, and evaluation outputs  

The goal is to allow the evaluation committee to:

- Understand how the results were produced  
- Inspect intermediate steps  
- Reproduce analyses when needed

## Note about missing figure in the thesis manuscript

The file `partial_correlations_numeric_table.png` is a summary image that was meant to be inserted into the thesis manuscript in **Results, subsection 4.1.4 “Partial Correlations”**, where there is currently still a text placeholder. Unfortunately, due to an error, this figure was not included in the final version of the document.

The image contains a table summarizing the results of the Pearson partial correlations among the analyzed numeric features:  
- cells containing a number indicate a statistically significant Pearson partial correlation (**p-value < 0.05**),  
- while blank cells indicate non-significant correlations.  

I sincerely apologize for this inconvenience and thank the evaluation committee for their understanding.

## Repository Structure Overview

The repository is organized by function and by research question (RQ):
.
├── python_notebooks/          # All code used in the thesis
├── constructed_datasets/      # Final datasets constracted and then used  in analyses
├── RQ1_outputs/               # Results for Research Question 1
├── rq2_*_outputs/             # Results for Research Question 2 (multiple models)
├── rq3_outputs/               # Results for Research Question 3

Each folder is explained in detail below.

## Recommended Reading / Usage Order

If you want to understand the full workflow:

- Start from `python_notebooks/`  
  - Notebooks explain data construction and analysis logic  
- Then check `constructed_datasets/`  
  - These are the final datasets produced by the dataset builder notebooks  
- Then read result folders in order:  
  - `RQ1_outputs/`  
  - `rq2_*_outputs/`  
  - `rq3_outputs/`  

This order roughly follows the thesis structure.

## Folder: `python_notebooks/`

This folder contains all Jupyter notebooks used to construct datasets and run analyses.

### Dataset construction notebooks

- `2_dataset_builder.ipynb`  
- `3_dataset_builder.ipynb`  
- `4_dataset_builder.ipynb`  

**Purpose:**  
These notebooks progressively build and clean the datasets used in the thesis.

**General process (high-level):**
- Load raw or intermediate linguistic/experimental data  
- Clean and normalize fields  
- Engineer features  
- Save final datasets into `constructed_datasets/`  

**Outputs:**  
Files in:

- `constructed_datasets/`
